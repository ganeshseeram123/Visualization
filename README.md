# GDP Visualization Dashboard

This repository contains the GDP Visualization Dashboard, an interactive tool designed to explore and analyze global GDP data across various countries and economic sectors. This README outlines the procedures followed in the project, the content included in the HTML code, and the steps taken to create the visualizations.

## Project Overview

The GDP Visualization Dashboard aims to provide an insightful view into the economic performance of different countries with an emphasis on sector contributions such as agriculture, industry, and services. The project leverages powerful visualization tools like Tableau and D3.js to create interactive charts that facilitate a deeper understanding of economic trends.

## Procedure

### Data Abstraction

1. **Data Collection**: We gathered GDP data segmented by country and sector from reputable sources.
2. **Data Cleaning**: The data was cleaned to ensure accuracy, removing any inconsistencies and preparing it for analysis.

### Data Transformation

1. **Normalization**: Data was normalized to ensure compatibility across different visualization tools and to standardize the measurement scales for accurate comparison.
2. **Data Structuring**: We structured the data in a way that is suitable for visualization, organizing it by country and sector.

### Visualization Creation

1. **Tableau Visualizations**:
   - **Interactive Maps**: Created to show GDP data geographically, allowing users to click on a country to see detailed metrics.
   - **Line Charts**: Developed to display trends in GDP and sector contributions over time.
   - **Bar Charts**: Used to compare GDP across countries and to show sector contributions within each country.

2. **D3.js Visualizations**:
   - **Bubble Charts**: Implemented to illustrate the relationship between agricultural land use and GDP.
   - **Area Plots**: Designed to show changes in agricultural land use over time, highlighting trends and shifts.
   - **Stream Graphs**: Created to visualize the progression of multiple data categories over time, providing a dynamic landscape of economic performance.

### Deployment

- **VizHub**: The project is hosted on VizHub, enabling real-time interaction with the visualizations and global accessibility.

## Content Included in HTML Code

The `index.html` file includes:
- Descriptive sections introducing the project and each visualization.
- Interactive visualizations embedded using Tableau and D3.js.
- CSS for styling to enhance readability and user engagement.

## Usage

To explore the visualizations:
1. Open the `index.html` in a web browser.
2. Interact with the visualizations to filter, drill-down, and explore different aspects of the GDP data.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the power of data visualization in making complex economic data accessible and understandable. Through the use of advanced tools like Tableau and D3.js, we have created a platform that not only displays static data but also allows users to interact with and explore the data in meaningful ways.
